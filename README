# IB2D-MATLAB

This directory contains code for running a 2D immersed boundary simulation of an elastic curve imbeded in a fluid. The code uses the Navier Stokes equations and periodic boundary conditions.

The original code (https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/ib_lecture_notes/index.html) was written by Charlie Peskin and was vectorized by Tristan Goodwill
